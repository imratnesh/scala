==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of India}}

The name ''India'' is derived from ''Indus'', which originates from the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindus|Hinduš]]''. The latter term stems from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu'', which was the historical local appellation for the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians as ''Indoi'' (Ινδοί), which translates as &quot;the people of the Indus&quot;.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}}

The geographical term ''Bharat'' ({{IPA-hns|ˈbʱaːrət̪|pron|hi-Bharat.ogg}}), which is recognised by the [[Constitution of India]] as an official name for the country,{{sfn|Ministry of Law and Justice 2008}} is used by [[Names of the Republic of India in its official languages|many Indian languages]] in its variations. The [[eponym]] of ''Bharat'' is [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]], a theological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India.

''[[Hindustan]]'' ({{IPA-hns|ɦɪnd̪ʊˈst̪aːn||Hindustan.ogg}}) was originally a [[Persian language|Persian]] word that meant &quot;Land of the Hindus&quot;; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and [[Pakistan]]. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety.{{sfn|Kaye|1997|pp = 639–640}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}}

==History==
{{Main|History of India|History of the Republic of India}}

===Ancient India===
The earliest authenticated [[Anatomically modern humans|human]] remains in [[South Asia]] date to about 30,000 years ago.{{sfn|Petraglia|Allchin||2007|p=6}} Nearly contemporaneous [[Mesolithic]] rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 89–93}} Around 7000 BCE, the first known [[Neolithic]] settlements appeared on the subcontinent in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in western Pakistan.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|pp = 24–25}} These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]],{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 21–23}} the first urban culture in South Asia;{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}} It flourished during 2600–1900&amp;nbsp;BCE in Pakistan and western India.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|p = 2}} Centred on cities such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Kalibangan]], and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}}
[[Image:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of Vedic period.]]
During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the [[Chalcolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}} were composed during this period,{{sfn|Witzel|2003|pp = 68–69}} and historians have analysed these to posit a [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 31}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}} The [[caste system]] arose during this period, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, free peasants and traders, and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure; and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical, state-level polities.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 41–43}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 200}} On the [[Deccan Plateau]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of [[megalith]]ic monuments dating from this period,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}} as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}}
[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra]], 6th century]]

In the late [[Vedic period]], around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the [[Ganges]] Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ''[[mahajanapada]]s''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 260-265}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 53–54}} The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created heterodox religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Buddhism, based on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 54–56}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 21}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 67–68}} Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 312–313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 300}} and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 78–79}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 70}} The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka]]'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]]''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 367}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 63}}

The [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], and the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[Western Asia|West]] and [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 89–90}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 408–415}} In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 92–95}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 89–91}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 98–99}} The renewal was reflected in a flowering of [[Sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]] and [[Architecture of India|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}}

===Medieval India===
[[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The granite [[gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].]]

The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}}

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the Tamil language.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of India|modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}} Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}}

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 68}} The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 47}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 6}} By repeatedly repulsing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol raiders]] in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of [[Human migration|migration]] of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 67}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp = 50–51}} The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}} Embracing a strong [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 12}} and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}}

===Early modern India===
[[File:Moghul.1590-95гг.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Writing the will and testament of the Mughal king court in Persian, 1590–1595]]

In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers,{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 80}} fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 164}} The resulting [[Mughal Empire]] did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 90–91}} and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under [[Akbar]], the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 158}} and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 169}} caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} resulting in greater patronage of [[Mughal painting|painting]], literary forms, textiles, and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 186}} Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajputs]], and the [[Sikh empire|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 256}} The &quot;single most important power&quot; that emerged in the early modern period was the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46984/Political-and-economic-decentralization-during-the-Mughal-decline#toc46986 |title=Regional states, c. 1700–1850 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English [[East India Company]], had established coastal outposts.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 44–49}} The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the [[Bengal]] region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 98–100}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Ludden|2002|pp = 128–132}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 51–55}} Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 68–71}} India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}} By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 289}}

Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor General of the [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the [[English Education Act 1835|education]] of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 151–152}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 94–99}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p = 83}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p = 50}} However, disaffection with the Company also grew during this time, and set off the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 100–103}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|pp = 85–86}} Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the [[British Raj|direct administration of India]] by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 239}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 103–108}} In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1885.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 183}}{{sfn|Sarkar|1983|pp = 1–4}}{{sfn|Copland|2001|pp = ix–x}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 123}}

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 260}} There was an increase in the number of large-scale [[Famine in India|famines]],{{sfn|Bose|Jalal|2011|p = 117}} and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 258}} There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} The railway network provided critical famine relief,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} notably reduced the cost of moving goods,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} After World War I, in which [[Indian Army during World War I|some one million Indians served]],{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 163}} a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a [[nonviolent]] movement of non-cooperation, of which [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] would become the leader and enduring symbol.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 167}} During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 195–197}} The next decade was beset with crises: [[India in World War II|Indian participation in World War II]], the Congress's final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism.

India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]], and part of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], began a north-eastward [[Plate tectonics|drift]] caused by [[seafloor spreading]] to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  Simultaneously, the vast [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyn]] [[oceanic crust]], to its northeast, began to [[subduction|subduct]] under the [[Eurasian plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], both created the [[Indian Ocean]] and caused the Indian [[continental crust]] eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the [[Himalayas]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast [[trough (geology)|trough]] that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 7}} and now constitutes the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Prakash et al.|2000}} Cut off from the plain by the ancient [[Aravalli Range]] lies the [[Thar Desert]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 11}}

The original Indian plate survives as [[South India|peninsular India]], the oldest and geologically most stable part of India.  It extends as far north as the [[Satpura Range|Satpura]] and [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in Jharkhand in the east.{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 8}} To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the [[Deccan Plateau]], is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]];{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|pp = 9–10}} the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old.

India's coastline measures {{Convert|7517|km|mi|-2}} in length; of this distance, {{Convert|5423|km|mi|-2}} belong to peninsular India and {{Convert|2094|km|mi|-2}} to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}} According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% [[mudflat]]s or marshy shores.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}}

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the [[Ganges]] and the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], both of which drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 15}} Important tributaries of the Ganges include the [[Yamuna]] and the [[Kosi River|Kosi]]; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes.{{sfn|Duff|1993|p = 353}} Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]], which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 16}} and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and the [[Tapti River|Tapti]], which drain into the [[Arabian Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 17}} Coastal features include the marshy [[Rann of Kutch]] of western India and the alluvial [[Sundarbans]] delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 12}} India has two archipelagos: the [[Lakshadweep]], coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the [[Andaman Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 13}}

The [[Climate of India|Indian climate]] is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter [[monsoon]]s.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian [[katabatic wind]]s from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.{{sfn|Posey|1994|p = 118}}{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 4}} The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: [[Climate of India#Tropical wet|tropical wet]], [[Climate of India#Tropical dry|tropical dry]], [[Climate of India#Subtropical humid|subtropical humid]], and [[Climate of India#Mountain|montane]].{{sfn|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p = 97}}

For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,{{sfn|Sarkar|2007|p = 84}} as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party [[coalition government|coalitions]] at the centre.{{sfn|Chander|2004|p = 117}}

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by [[Indira Gandhi]], who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new [[Janata Party]], which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a [[National Front (India)|National Front]] coalition, led by the newly formed [[Janata Dal]] in alliance with the [[Left Front (India)|Left Front]], won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived: it lasted just under two years.{{sfn|Bhambhri|1992|pp = 118, 143}} Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. But the Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a [[minority government]] led by [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]].{{sfn|The Hindu 2008}}

A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA). Led by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the NDA became the first non-Congress, [[coalition government]] to complete a five-year term.{{sfn|Dunleavy|Diwakar|Dunleavy|2007}} In the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 Indian general elections]], again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the [[Indian general election, 2009|2009 general election]] with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from [[Socialism in India|India's communist parties]].{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 384}} That year, [[Manmohan Singh]] became the first prime minister since [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in [[Indian general election, 1957|1957]] and [[Indian general election, 1962|1962]] to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.{{sfn|Business Standard|2009}} In the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]], Bharatiya Janata Party became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BJP first party since 1984 to win parliamentary majority on its own|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-first-party-since-1984-to-win-parliamentary-majority-on-its-own-1988981|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=DNA|date=16 May 2014|agency=IANS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Prime Minister]] of India is [[Narendra Modi]] who was also the former [[Chief Minister]] of [[Gujarat]].

Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations.

Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 15}} During the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Hindu mythology|mythology]], [[Hindu theology|theology]] and [[Hindu texts|literature]] were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as ''[[Dharma|dhárma]]'', ''[[Karma|kárma]]'', ''[[yoga|yóga]]'', and ''[[moksha|mokṣa]]'', were established.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}} India is notable for its [[Indian religions|religious diversity]], with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Jainism]] among the nation's major religions.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{sfn|Deutsch|1969|pp = 3, 78}} the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]]'', the [[Bhakti|''Bhakti'' movement]],{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} and by [[Buddhist philosophy]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1999}}

===Art and architecture===
Much of [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], including the [[Taj Mahal]], other works of [[Mughal architecture]], and [[Dravidian architecture|South Indian architecture]], blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|pp = 296–329}} [[Indian vernacular architecture|Vernacular architecture]] is also highly regional in it flavours. ''[[Vastu shastra]]'', literally &quot;science of construction&quot; or &quot;architecture&quot; and ascribed to [[Mamuni Mayan]],{{sfn|Silverman|2007|p = 20}} explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;{{sfn|Kumar|2000|p = 5}} it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p = 73}} As applied in [[Hindu temple architecture]], it is influenced by the ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'', a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the ''Vastu-Purusha mandala'', a square that embodied the &quot;[[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lang|Moleski|2010|pp = 151–152}} The Taj Mahal, built in [[Agra]] between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] in memory of his wife, has been described in the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] as &quot;the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.&quot;{{sfn|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation}} [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on [[Indo-Islamic architecture]].{{sfn|Chopra|2011|p = 46}}

===Literature===
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Hoiberg|Ramchandani|2000}}{{sfn|Sarma|2009}} Prominent works of this [[Sanskrit literature]] include [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] such as the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the dramas of [[Kālidāsa]] such as the ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'' (''[[The Recognition of Śakuntalā]]''), and poetry such as the ''[[Sanskrit Classical poetry|Mahākāvya]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|2008}}{{sfn|MacDonell|2004|pp = 1–40}}{{sfn|Kālidāsa|Johnson|2001}} [[Kamasutra]], the famous book about [[sexual intercourse]] also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the [[Sangam literature|''Sangam'' literature]], consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of [[Tamil literature]].{{sfn|Zvelebil|1997|p = 12}}{{sfn|Hart|1975}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2008}}{{sfn|Ramanujan|1985|pp = ix–x}} From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of [[Bhakti movement|devotional poets]] such as [[Kabir|Kabīr]], [[Tulsidas|Tulsīdās]], and [[Guru Nanak|Guru Nānak]]. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.{{sfn|Das|2005}} In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the [[Works of Rabindranath Tagore|works]] of Bengali poet and novelist [[Rabindranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Datta|2006}}

[[Music of India|Indian music]] ranges over various traditions and regional styles. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and southern [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] schools.{{sfn|Massey|Massey|1998}} Regionalised popular forms include [[filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]]; the syncretic tradition of the ''[[baul]]s'' is a well-known form of the latter. [[Dance in India|Indian dance]] also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known [[List of Indian folk dances|folk dances]] are the ''[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]'' of Punjab, the ''[[bihu dance|bihu]]'' of Assam, the ''[[Chhau dance|chhau]]'' of Odisha,  West Bengal and Jharkhand, ''[[Garba (dance)|garba]]'' and ''[[Dandiya Raas|dandiya]]'' of Gujarat, ''[[ghoomar]]'' of Rajasthan, and the ''[[lavani]]'' of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded [[Classical Indian dance|classical dance status]] by India's [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama]]. These are: ''[[Bharata Natyam|bharatanatyam]]'' of the state of Tamil Nadu, ''[[kathak]]'' of Uttar Pradesh, ''[[kathakali]]'' and ''[[mohiniyattam]]'' of Kerala,'' [[kuchipudi]]'' of Andhra Pradesh, ''[[Manipuri dance|manipuri]]'' of Manipur, ''[[odissi]]'' of Odisha&lt;!--Do not change this per [[WP:COMMONNAME]].--&gt;, and the ''[[sattriya]]'' of Assam.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica b}} [[Theatre in India]] melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.{{sfn|Lal|2004|pp = 23, 30, 235}} Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the ''[[bhavai]]'' of Gujarat, the ''[[Jatra (Bengal)|jatra]]'' of West Bengal, the ''[[nautanki]]'' and ''[[ramlila]]'' of North India, ''[[tamasha]]'' of Maharashtra, ''[[burrakatha]]'' of Andhra Pradesh, ''[[terukkuttu]]'' of Tamil Nadu, and the ''[[yakshagana]]'' of Karnataka.{{sfn|Karanth|2002|p = 26}}

===Motion pictures, television===

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as ''[[jāti]]s'', or &quot;castes&quot;.{{sfn|Schwartzberg|2011}} India declared untouchability to be illegal&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spiritual Terrorism: Spiritual Abuse from the Womb to the Tomb&quot;, p. 391, by Boyd C. Purcell&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance.{{sfn|Messner|2009|p = 51-53}}{{sfn|Messner|2012|p = 27-28}} Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.{{sfn|Makar|2007}} An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|their marriages arranged]] by their parents or other family members.{{sfn|Medora|2003}} Marriage is thought to be for life,{{sfn|Medora|2003}} and the divorce rate is extremely low.{{sfn|Jones|Ramdas|2005|p = 111}} [[Child marriage]]s are common, especially in rural areas; many [[women in India]] wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.{{sfn|Cullen-Dupont|2009|p = 96}} [[Female infanticide in India]] and [[female foeticide in India]] have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation.{{sfn|Bunting|2011}}{{sfn|Agnivesh|2005}} However the recent report from 2011 shown improvement among the gender ratio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_And_You/gender_composition.aspx Census of India-Gender Composition] 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The payment of [[Dowry system in India|Dowry]], although [[Dowry law in India|illegal]], remains widespread across class lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10280802/Woman-killed-over-dowry-every-hour-in-India.html|title=Woman killed over dowry 'every hour' in India |publisher=telegraph.com |accessdate=10 February 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dowry deaths|Deaths resulting from dowry]], mostly from [[bride burning]], is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rising-number-of-dowry-deaths-in-india-ncrb/article4995677.ece|title=Rising number of dowry deaths in India:NCRB|publisher=thehindu.com |accessdate=10 February 2014|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Public holidays in India|Indian festivals]] are religious in origin; among them are [[Chhath]], [[Christmas worldwide#Republic of India|Christmas]], [[Diwali]], [[Durga Puja]], [[Eid al-Adha|Bakr-Id]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Holi]], [[Makar Sankranti|Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan]], [[Navratri]], [[Thai Pongal]], and [[Vaisakhi]]. India has [[Public holidays in India|three national holidays]] which are observed in all states and union territories: [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]], [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]], and [[Gandhi Jayanti]]. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states.

Throughout India, many people practice customs and religious rituals, such as &quot;[[Saṃskāra]],&quot; which is a series of &quot;personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/273190/Housing India]&quot;.

Traditional [[Clothing in India|Indian dress]] varies in colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as the ''[[sari]]'' for women and the ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'' for men. Stitched clothes, such as the ''[[shalwar kameez]]'' for women and ''[[kurta]]''–''[[Pajamas|pyjama]]'' combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|pp = xii, xii, 11, 15, 28, 46}} Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.{{sfn|Eraly|2008|p = 160}}

In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as ''[[kabaddi]]'', ''[[kho kho]]'', ''[[pehlwani]]'' and ''[[gilli-danda]]''. Some of the earliest forms of Asian [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]], such as ''[[kalarippayattu]]'', ''[[musti yuddha]]'', ''[[silambam]]'', and ''[[marma adi]]'', originated in India. [[Chess]], commonly held to have [[History of chess#India|originated in India]] as ''[[chaturanga|chaturaṅga]]'', is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]].{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 2}}{{sfn|Rediff 2008 b}} ''[[Pachisi]]'', from which [[parcheesi]] derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.{{sfn|Binmore|2007|p = 98}}

The improved results garnered by the [[India Davis Cup team|Indian Davis Cup team]] and other [[:Category:Indian tennis players|Indian tennis players]] in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.{{sfn|The Wall Street Journal 2009}} India has a [[:Category:Indian sport shooters|comparatively strong presence]] in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the [[ISSF World Shooting Championships|World Shooting Championships]], and the Commonwealth Games.{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 b}}{{sfn|The Times of India 2010}} Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 a}} boxing,{{sfn|Mint 2010}} and wrestling.{{sfn|Xavier|2010}} [[Football in India|Football]] is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.{{sfn|Majumdar|Bandyopadhyay|2006|pp = 1–5}}

[[Field hockey in India]] is administered by [[Hockey India]]. The [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian national hockey team]] won the 1975 [[Hockey World Cup]] and have, as of 2012, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.

[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|thumb|250px|right| In a career of twenty four-year span, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] has created almost all batting records, including most runs in both tests and ODIs and most number of centuries in both tests and ODIs, thus making him the most successful cricketer ever.]]
India has also played a major role in popularising [[cricket]]. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport of India. The [[India national cricket team|Indian national cricket team]] won the [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] events, the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], shared the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and won [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. [[Cricket in India]] is administered by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI); the [[Ranji Trophy]], the [[Duleep Trophy]], the [[Deodhar Trophy]], the [[Irani Trophy]], and the [[NKP Salve Challenger Trophy]] are domestic competitions. The BCCI is also responsible for conducting an annual [[Twenty20]] competition known as the [[Indian Premier League]].

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1982 Asian Games]]; the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]], and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] tournaments; the [[2003 Afro-Asian Games]]; the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]]; the [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup|2010 Hockey World Cup]]; and the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the [[Chennai Open]], the [[Mumbai Marathon]], the [[Delhi Half Marathon]], and the [[Indian Masters]]. The first [[Indian Grand Prix]] featured in late 2011.{{sfn|Dehejia|2011}}

India has traditionally been the dominant country at the [[South Asian Games]]. An example of this dominance is the [[Basketball at the South Asian Games|basketball competition]] where [[India national basketball team|Team India]] won three out of four tournaments to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/02-Jan-2010/Basketball-team-named-for-11th-South-Asian-Games |title=Basketball team named for 11th South Asian Games |publisher=Nation.com.pk |date=2 January 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]] and the [[Arjuna Award]] are the highest forms of government recognition for athletic achievement; the [[Dronacharya Award]] is awarded for excellence in coaching.

Early classical Tamil literature (c. 100 BC – AD 250) consists of the Eight Anthologies (''Eţţuttokai''), the Ten Long Poems (''Pattuppāţţu''), and a grammar called the ''Tolkāppiyam'' or the 'Old Composition.'&amp;nbsp;...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">The '''Teape Lectures''' were established at [[Cambridge University]] in 1955.  They form the major activity of the Teape Trust ([[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity No]] 250095), created from an endowment made posthumously by William Marshall Teape (St John's College, Cambridge 1882, died 1945).&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marshall Teape|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A45035|publisher=[[AustLit]]|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the trust is 'The advancement of education by the provision of lectures on the relationship between [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] thought and subject thereto the study of Christian and Hindu religious thought and the promotion of [[Christianity_and_other_religions#Relations_with_Hinduism|Christian-Hindu]] relations'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cambridge University Reporter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures are among the most prestigious engagements for Christian-Hindu relations, as evidenced from the list of major speakers who have held the appointments, and from the internationally significant publications that have emerged from many of the lecture series.

The lectures are typically delivered in Cambridge by a speaker from India or in India by a speaker with a Cambridge connection.  They reflect a close association between [[Westcott House, Cambridge]] and [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]].

==Facility==
The factory covers 104.10 Hectares, out of which 40.49 hectares is covered.

Infrastructure consists of industrial/commercial buildings and services including power, water, sewage, air conditioning, drainage, compressed air supply etc.

As part of its diversification programme, the product range of the factory has been expanded to serve civilian markets including personal weapons.

The factory has implemented International Quality Management System standard ([[ISO 9001]]: 2000) in all  activities. The factory has a NABL accredited lab. to ensure that all measurement devices and instruments are calibrated to international standards.

== Indian administered Kashmir removed as reference link is broken ==

I've removed the sentence ', whereas some international agencies such as the United Nations call it Indian-administered Kashmir.[4]' as the link itself is broken and no one calls it so. It is mostly referred all over the world as [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-npov2 --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:jinishans|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#FF9933&quot;&gt;jinishans&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:jinishans&lt;b style=&quot;color:#FF9933&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;[[User:Jinishans|Jinishans]] ([[User talk:Jinishans|talk]]) 00:10, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

existing categories/sub categories of the article did not articulate Jammu and Kashmir (Indian) was related to categories of  
[Category:States and territories of India]], [[Category:India]], [[Category:Kashmir]]. There appear to be no objection to the content itself, just the assignment of additional categories and not using existing category - is that correct? --[[User:Sdmarathe|Sdmarathe]] ([[User talk:Sdmarathe|talk]]) 17:03, 23 November 2014 (UTC)

== Indicscripts ==

I got this [[User_talk:TopGun/Archives/2014/October#Question_about_this_consensus|reviewed by many uninvolved editors]] so I am going to completely disregard [[WP:INDICSCRIPTS]] consensus as this article is not [[WP:OWN|only managed by a single project]] being a disputed territory and being related to international projects regardless of which nation is right / wrong or holds any direct influence in the actual Kashmir conflict. Being under the scope of multiple projects, it conforms to general wikipedia standards and wider norms such as those followed at other projects in addition to the fact that Urdu is not even an Indicscript, rather persio-arabic. I didn't get what you meant by the state having other scripts as well because I am not against adding the other scripts as well. Is there any argument ''other than'' indicscripts that is behind that revert? Including all scripts is a constructive move IMO, but its no big deal and silly to re-revert over it so let's discuss here. --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:30, 17 December 2014 (UTC)

: {{reply to|TopGun}} Russia lays claims to the [[Artic]] - should all Artic-related articles thus follow [[WP:RUSSIA]] guidelines? If you read the discussion again, the consensus was not about a particular project but about &quot;India-related articles&quot;. Since currently [[Jammu and Kashmir]] lies in India, and [[Azad Kashmir]] in Pakistan, geographies of these territories follow the guidelines set by the two projects. I understand you would like to have Nastaliq script in anything with even most remote interest for WP:PAKISTAN - but please, for all practical reasons [[Kargil]] is on Indian-controlled territory, and &quot;Jammu and Kashmir&quot; designates the part controlled by India. For the entire area, see [[Kashmir and Jammu]]; you can have Nastaliq there. Besides, WP:PAKISTAN even doesn't have a section that would deal with geography of regions outside of current Pakistan. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:40, 18 December 2014 (UTC)

::You can read the clarifications that I got from multiple editors in my first link above. Territory or control has nothing to do with which topic interests which wikiproject by default. The consensus was achieved at a wikiproject page, ''for'' the wikiproject and ''for indicscripts''...  so it can only be applied to articles managed normally by that project only. It has nothing to do with ''India'', rather WP:India. I don't know why you think I would push Nastaliq script in anything with remote interest for Pakistan, I also favour regional languages though usually Urdu seems to be the way to go in Pakistan only articles. I am fine by adding all three languages. I did not need to ask for matters not related to just WT:India at that page plus that I was not the one who started the clarification discussion. Anyway, I think you do get the point that any editor is going to come to the same conclusion. Wikiprojects ''do'' deal with articles of claims, diaspora and wars etc and these articles mostly have more than one wikiproject dealing with them. My question here was if there's another argument except for Indic scripts? --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 06:51, 18 December 2014 (UTC)
:::Ahem. Jammu and Kashmir is India controlled as stated above. Azad Kashmir is Pakistan occupied/controlled. Apply whatever policies you want to apply there. Since you have openly stated that you are going to 'disregard' a decision that was made by a group of people, I don't think it will be a great issue to disregard your opinion as well. As for your 'review', hats off for doing it on your talk page. The lease you could have done was notify [[WP:INB]] about it, but you chose not to, which is not surprising given that you [[Wikipedia talk:Canvassing#Canvassing Country / Nation level Wikiprojects|started a proposal]] to ban that and stifle such discussion.

I would add that the problem of multiple scripts exists even if this were Pakistani territory; people in the state regularly use at least three different scripts, according to the sources I have read.

== Confusing lead section? ==

{{quote|Formerly a part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, which governed the larger historic region of Kashmir, the region is the subject of a territorial conflict...}}

I am not sure if it's only me but I find lede slightly confusing for an uninitiated leader. As early as in the second paragraph of the lead we get a plethora of terms containing the word &quot;Kashmir&quot;, and as as result the reader must be getting lost as to what specifically this article is all about. (This seems to be not clear even to many editors, judging from the text!).

In my understanding, the intention is that &quot;Jammu and Kashmir&quot; should relate strictly to the ''current administrative entity in India'', i.e., only to the territories under actual Indian control. A mirror article about Pakistani-controlled territories is [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] (and, partly, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]) which, similarly, should deal only with the administrative entity within the Pakistani structures. So, in my view this article should only marginally touch upon the broader [[Kashmir conflict]], and definitely it should steer clear from confusing the geographic reach of Jammu &amp; Kashmir with the reach of the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir and Jammu.

In its current form, the lead section is way too overloaded with references to the conflict and to territories outside J&amp;K, including naming disputes for a Pakistani administrative entity.

I suggest that the second para is rewritten.

Similarly, much of the content in the History section below is overladen with references to the conflict, '''even though the territorial dispute does not relate specifically to J&amp;K but to the entire Kashmir region''', and the analysis unnecessarily duplicates [[Kashmir conflict]].

I suggest this article is left to describe the land controlled by India; AJK article to talk about Pakistani-administered land; and all discussion about the conflict (except brief mentions) is relegated to [[Kashmir conflict]]. Regards, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Candara',sans-serif;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kashmiri|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#30C;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-shadow:#AAF 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;kashmiri&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#80F;&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:27, 10 January 2015 (UTC)

: I did a minor copy edit of the confusing sentence you pointed out. This doesn't address all other problems you point out, however. As you know, the subject is a minefield, and making larger changes is likely to be very contentious.

[[Image:India 78.40398E 20.74980N.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The geographic region containing the [[Indian subcontinent]]]]
{{India topics sidebar}}
The '''name ''India''''' may refer to either the region of [[Greater India]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]) or to the contemporary [[Republic of India]] located therein. The name is derived from the name of the [[Indus]], or Sindhu, river and has been in use in Greek since [[Herodotus]] (4th century BC). The term appeared in [[Old English]] as early the 9th century and reemerged in [[Modern English]] in the 17th century. 

The Republic of India has two principal short names in both official and popular English usage, each of which is historically significant, ''India ''and ''Bharat'''. '''''The first article of the [[Constitution of India]] states that &quot;India, that is Bharat, shall be a union of states,&quot; implicitly codifying ''India'' and ''Bharat'' as equally official short names for the Republic of India. A third name, ''[[Hindustan]]'', is a historical term for the north and northwestern subcontinent (especially during the [[British Raj|British India]] period) that is now widely used as an alternative name for the region comprising most of the modern nations of the subcontinent when Indians speak among themselves. The usage of ''Bharat'', ''Hindustan'' or ''India'' is dependant on the context and language of conversation. 

According to the ''[[Manusmṛti]]'' (2.21–22) North India (i.e., India north of the [[Vindhyas]]) is also known as [[Āryāvarta]] (Sanskrit: आर्यावर्त, &quot;abode of the [[Aryans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Madhav Deshpande, [http://books.google.gr/books/about/Sanskrit_Prakrit.html?id=NDrqaELkKTEC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Sanskrit &amp; Prakrit: Sociolinguistic Issues''], Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1993, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The English term is from [[Classical Greek|Greek]] Ἰνδία (''Indía''), via Latin ''India''. ''Indía'' in [[Koine Greek]] denoted the region of the Indus (&quot;Ἰνδός&quot;) river in [[Pakistan]], since [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC) {{lang|grc|ἡ Ἰνδική χώρη}}, ''hē Indikē chōrē''; &quot;Indian land&quot;, {{lang|grc|Ἰνδός}}, ''Indos'', &quot;an Indian&quot;, from [[Old Persian]]  (referring to what is now known as [[Sindh]], a province of present day [[Pakistan]], and listed as a conquered territory by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]] in the [[Persepolis]] terrace inscription).
The name is derived ultimately from ''Sindhu'', the [[Sanskrit]] name of the river, but also meaning &quot;river&quot; generically.
Latin ''India'' is used by [[Lucian]] (2nd century). India is referred to as Indu in Chinese and Indhu desam/Indhiya in Tamil.

The name '''India''' was known in [[Old English language|Old English]], and was used in [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. In [[Middle English]], the name was, under French influence, replaced by ''Ynde'' or ''Inde'', which entered [[Early Modern English]] as ''Indie''.  The name ''India'' then came back to English usage from the 17th century onwards, and may be due to the influence of Latin, or Spanish or Portuguese.

Sanskrit ''indu'' &quot;drop (of [[Soma]])&quot;, also a term for the [[Moon]], is unrelated, but has sometimes been erroneously connected, listed by, among others, Colonel James Todd in his ''Annals of Rajputana''. Todd  describes  ancient India as under control of tribes claiming descent from the Moon, or &quot;Indu&quot; (referring to [[Chandravanshi|Chandravanshi Rajputs]]).

==Bhārata (Bhāratavarsha)==
The name Bhārata ({{IPAc-en|b|'|h|a:|r|ə|θ}}) ({{lang|sa|भारत}}) has been used as a self-ascribed name by people of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the [[Republic of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the English version of the [[Constitution of India]]: &quot;India that is Bharat shall be a Union of States.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhārata'' is the official Sanskrit name of the country, ''{{Unicode|Bhārata Gaṇarājya}}'', and the name is derived from the ancient Indian texts, that  which refers to the land that comprises India as ''Bhārata {{Unicode|varṣam''}}, and uses this term to distinguish it from other {{Unicode|''varṣa''s}} or continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;pargiter&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Ancient Indian Historical Tradition|last=Pargiter|first=F. F.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|place=Delhi|year=1922|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Vayu Purana]]s says ''he who conquers the whole of Bharata-varsa is celebrated as a samrāt'' (Vayu Purana 45, 86).&lt;ref name=&quot;pargiter&quot;&gt;pages=ff. 8 p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; However in some puranas, the term 'Bharate' refers to the whole Earth as Emperor Bharata is said to have ruled the whole Earth. Until the death of Maharaja [[Parikshit]], the last formidable emperor of the Kuru dynasty, the known world was known as Bharata varsha.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.Bhartas was also a community as mentioned in Rigveda.

According to the most popular theory the name Bhārata is the [[vrddhi]] of Bharata, a king mentioned in [[Rigveda]].

The Sanskrit word ''bhārata'' is a vrddhi derivation of ''bharata'', which was originally an epithet of [[Agni]]. The term is a verbal noun of the Sanskrit root bhr-,  &quot;to bear / to carry&quot;, with a literal meaning of &quot;to be maintained&quot; (of [[fire]]). The [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''bhr'' is cognate with the English verb ''to bear'' and Latin ''ferō''.
This term also means &quot;one who is engaged in search for knowledge&quot;.

According to the Puranas(Gita), this country is known as Bharatavarsha after the king Bharata Chakravarti. This has been mentioned in Vishnu Purana (2,1,31), Vayu Purana,(33,52), Linga Purana(1,47,23), Brahmanda Purana (14,5,62), Agni Purana ( 107,11–12), Skanda Purana, Khanda (37,57) and Markandaya Purana (50,41) it is clearly stated that this country is known as Bharata Varsha.
Vishnu Purāna mentions:
:ऋषभो मरुदेव्याश्च ऋषभात भरतो भवेत्
:भरताद भारतं वर्षं, भरतात सुमतिस्त्वभूत्
:Rishabha was born to Marudevi, Bharata was born to Rishabh,
:Bharatavarsha (India) arose from Bharata, and Sumati arose from Bharata
::—Vishnu Purana (2,1,31)

:ततश्च भारतं वर्षमेतल्लोकेषुगीयते
:भरताय यत: पित्रा दत्तं प्रतिष्ठिता वनम  (विष्णु पुराण, २,१,३२)
:This country is known as Bharatavarsha since the times the father entrusted the kingdom to the son Bharata and he himself went to the forest for ascetic practices [ [[Rishabha]]/ Rishabdev is First Trithankar (Teacher) of [[Jainism]]. He had two sons Bharat and Bahubali' ]
::—Vishnu Purana (2,1,32)

The realm of Bharata is known as ''{{Unicode|Bharātavarṣa}}'' in the ''[[Mahabhārata]]''
(the core portion of which is itself known as ''Bhārata'') and later texts. The term ''varsa'' means a division of the earth, or a continent. [http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/]
A version of the Bhagavata Purana says, the name Bharata is after Jata Bharata who appears in the fifth canto of the Bhagavata.

::- Vishnu Purana (2.3.1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/3_purana/visnup_u.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/puranas/vishnu_purana.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''{{IAST|uttaraṃ yatsamudrasya himādreścaiva dakṣiṇam&lt;br&gt;varṣaṃ tadbhārataṃ nāma bhāratī yatra santatiḥ}}''

:उत्तरं यत्समुद्रस्य हिमाद्रेश्चैव दक्षिणम् ।
:वर्षं तद् भारतं नाम भारती यत्र संततिः ।।
: &quot;The country (''{{Unicode|varṣam}}'') that lies north of the [[samudra|ocean]] and south of the snowy mountains is called  ''Bhāratam''; there dwell the descendants of Bharata.&quot;

The term in Classical [[Sanskrit literature]] is taken to comprise the present day territories of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Republic of India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. This corresponds to the approximate extent of the historical [[Maurya Empire]] under emperors [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] (4th to 3rd centuries BC). Later political entities unifying approximately the same region are the [[Mughal Empire]] (17th century), the [[Maratha Empire]] (18th century), and the [[British Raj]] (19th to 20th centuries).

== Hindustan ==
{{Main|Hindustan}}

The name ''Hind'' ({{lang-fa|هند}}) is derived from the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] equivalent of ''[[Sindh]]''. The [[Persian language|Persian]] [[-stan|''-stān'']] means &quot;country&quot; or &quot;land&quot; (cognate to Sanskrit ''sthāna'' &quot;place, land&quot;).

Modern day North India was included as ''Hindustān'' هندوستان in Persian, الهند is the term in the [[Arabic language]] (e.g. in the 11th century. It also occurs intermittently in usage within India, such as in the phrase ''[[Jai Hind]]'' ({{lang-hi|जय हिन्द}}).

''Hindustān'', as the term &quot;India&quot; itself, entered the English language in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the term as used in English referred to the northern region of the subcontinent between the [[Indus]] and [[Brahmaputra]] rivers and between the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Vindhyas]] in particular, hence the term [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] for the Hindi-Urdu language.
''Hindustan'' was in use synonymously with ''India'' during the [[British Raj]].

Today, ''Hindustān'' is no longer in use as the official name for India, although in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] as well as dialects it is the only name for India, (al-Hind الهند).

== Āryāvarta ==
Āryāvarta {{IPAc-en|a:|r|j|a:|v|ə|r|t}}; (Sanskrit: आर्यावर्त, &quot;abode of the Aryans&quot;) is a name for North India in classical Sanskrit literature.[1] The Manu Smriti (2.22) gives the name to &quot;the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)&quot;.

==Jambudvipa==
[[Jambudvipa]] was used in ancient scriptures for the name of India before Bharata became the official name scriptures began using.

==Nabhivarsha==
According to the [[Bhagavata Purana]], before India was called Bharatvarsha, it was known as Nabhivarsha after [[Nabhi Rajah]], the son of [[Agnidhara]] (ruler of India) and father of [[Rishabha (Hinduism)|Rishabha]].

==Tianzhu==
Tianzhu (天竺) Chinese  Tang dynasty in reference to the Indian origins of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;後百餘歲，貴霜翕候丘就卻攻滅四翕候，自立為王，國號貴霜王。侵安息，取高附地。又滅濮達、罽賓，悉有其國。丘就卻年八十餘死，子閻膏珍代為王。復滅天竺，置將一人監領之。月氏自此之後，最為富盛，諸國稱之皆曰貴霜王。漢本其故號，言大月氏云。Hanshu, 96 [http://www.guoxue.com/discord/xwm/jnsj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenjiku]] (天竺) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word, which derives from Chinese word [[Tianzhu]](天竺) commonly used in reference to pre-modern India. ''Tian'', the root word for the Japanese [[kanji]], means &quot;heaven&quot;, while, ''jiku,'' means: &quot;the centre of&quot;, or 'primary concentration of'. The foreign loanwords Indo (インド) and India (インディア) are also used in some cases.

The current [[Putonghua|Chinese]] word for India is ''Yindu'' (印度). Sindhu, the term ''yin'' was used in classical Chinese much like the English ''Ind''. The monk [[Xuanzang]] referred to India as ''Wu Yin'' or &quot;Five Inds&quot;. The current Japanese name for modern India is the foreign loanword Indo (インド).

==Hodu==

Hodu ([[Hebrew]]: הדו ) is the [[Biblical Hebrew|Biblical]] [[Hebrew]] name for India mentioned in the [[Book of Esther]] part of the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] (Bible), and Christian Old Testament. In Esther 1:1, [[Ahasuerus]] (Xerxes) had been described as King ruling 127 provinces from ''Hodu'' (India) to ''[[Ethiopia]]''.  &lt;ref&gt;http://uskojaelama.net/lange/ot/est/1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

|  &quot;The boundary of the land of India towards the north is Mount Taurus. It is not still called Taurus in this land; but Taurus begins from the sea over against Pamphylia and Lycia and Cilicia; and reaches as far as the Eastern Ocean, running right across Asia. But the mountain has different names in different places; in one, Parapamisus, in another Hemodus; elsewhere it is called Imaon, and perhaps has all sorts of other names; but the Macedonians who fought with Alexander called it Caucasus; another Caucasus, that is, not the Scythian; so that the story ran that Alexander came even to the far side of the Caucasus. The western part of India is bounded by the river Indus right down to the ocean, where the river runs out by two mouths, not joined together as are the five mouths of the Ister; but like those of the Nile, by which the Egyptian delta is formed; thus also the Indian delta is formed by the river Indus, not less than the Egyptian; and this in the Indian tongue is called Pattala. Towards the south this ocean bounds the land of India, and eastward the sea itself is the boundary. The southern part near Pattala and the mouths of the Indus were surveyed by Alexander and Macedonians, and many Greeks; as for the eastern part, Alexander did not traverse this beyond the river Hyphasis. A few historians have described the parts which are this side of the Ganges and where are the mouths of the Ganges and the city of Palimbothra, the greatest Indian city on the Ganges. (...) The Indian rivers are greater than any others in Asia; greatest are the Ganges and the Indus, whence the land gets its name; each of these is greater than the Nile of Egypt and the Scythian Ister, even were these put together; my own idea is that even the Acesines is greater than the Ister and the Nile, where the Acesines having taken in the Hydaspes, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis, runs into the Indus, so that its breadth there becomes thirty stades. Possibly also other greater rivers run through the land of India.&quot;

The CPPA is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) focused on foreign policy, national security, human rights, refugee and international humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire, Businesswire.com Washington, D.C.

==Religious freedom violations ==

The CPPA conducts research, and develops awareness about, religious freedom violations, and religious persecution, in the [[Marxist]] Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) and other countries, including the killing of independent and dissident [[Buddhist]]s, [[Christians]] and [[Animist]] religious believers.

The CPPA has provided information about the [[Lao People's Army]] and [[Vietnam People's Army]] military attacks against minority Lao and Hmong [[Catholics]], [[Protestant]] Christians in Vietnam and Laos including the killing of religious believers in various provinces in Laos and in [[Dien Bien Phu]] Province, and other places, in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph (UK), (16 April 2011) &quot;Laos, Vietnam troops kill Hmong Christians&quot; http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/laos-vietnam-troops-kill-hmong-christians/story-e6freuyi-1226040033388&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the CPPA raised awareness about the plight of [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], Protestant, Christian Hmong-American pastor Naw Karl Moua (Mua)'s arrest in Laos by Lao military and security forces, along with independent journalists, investigating Lao and Hmong Christians suffering persecution and military attacks under the [[Pathet Lao]] government.&lt;ref&gt;Lourdes Medrano,  Leslie Star Tribune, Minneapolis, MN, (24 June 2003) &quot;St. Paul family worries, awaits word on pastor jailed in Laos.&quot;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-104248750.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press,(24 June 2003), &quot;Jailed pastor becomes symbol for human rights activists&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-74831503.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the CPPA confirmed military attacks by [[Vietnam People's Army]] and [[Lao People's Army]] forces on ethnic minority Hmong Christians, at least four of whom were brutally killed by the soldiers. &lt;ref&gt; Agence France Press (AFP),(15 April 2011)&quot;Laos, Vietnam troops kill four Hmong Christians: NGO&quot;  http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos,+Vietnam+troops+kill+four+Hmong+Christians%3A+NGO-a01612449350 &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) massive military crackdown and attacks against Catholic and Protestant Christians in Vietnam's Dien Bien Province and along the Laos - Vietnam border area, in 2011, Philip Smith wrote an editorial in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, ''Star Tribune'' entitled &quot;A new era of abuse in Southeast Asia&quot; raising concerns about religious persecution in [[Southeast Asia]], especially in Vietnam and Laos, directed against minority Christian and Animist religious believers, especially the Hmong people.&lt;ref&gt;Star Tribune, Minneapolis, Minnesota, (26 June 2011) &quot;A new era of abuse in Southeast Asia&quot; http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/124518218.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith's stated: &quot;After deploying the military and sealing off the area to journalists last month, VPA special forces have pursued ethnic Hmong involved in mass protests.... Hmong demonstrators, including many honoring the beatification of Pope John Paul II last month in Vietnam's largest Catholic diocese, Hung Hoa, have fled a violent army crackdown that continues in northeastern Vietnam's Dien Bien Province, along the border with Laos.&quot;

The CPPA has raised concerns about the persecution of Catholic, Protestant and other believers in Vietnam, including efforts to curtail or halt the celebration of Christmas and Easter ceremonies by the secret police and security forces in Vietnam, especially from 2003-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Timothy, Ecumenical News, (19 July 2013) &quot;Vietnamese Catholics fleeing to Australia 'to avoid persecution'&quot; http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/vietnamese-catholics-fleeing-to-australia-to-avoid-persecution-22345&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014-2015, according to news reports and editorials in ''The Diplomat'', ''Wall Street Journal'' and other sources, the CPPA and others issued reports about violent attacks by [[Hanoi]]-backed police and security forces in Laos, including [[Lao People's Army]] and [[Vietnam People's Army]] military forces, to seek to brutalized independent Laotian and Hmong believers, including Christians, Animists and Buddhists seeking to worship independently of government monitors and official state approval.  Lao authorities, reportedly backed by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam security forces reportedly sought to prevent Laotian and Hmong Christians from celebrating Christmas worship services and Christmas celebrations in their homes. Some of the religious believers were reportedly brutally attacked, arrested and tortured, and killed by authorities over the Christmas 2014 holiday season. &lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Luke, The Diplomat, (6 January 2015) &quot;Laos’ Holiday Crackdown: The government chose the holiday season to crack down on its ethnic Hmong population.&quot;http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/laos-holiday-crackdown &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, (8 January 2015) &quot;Silent Night in Laos: The communist government in Laos uses the holiday season to pursue a violent crackdown on Christians of the Hmong ethnic minority&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/silent-night-in-laos-1420758189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Wiser, Daniel, The Washington Free Beacon,(9 January 2015) &quot;Christians Tortured, Killed in Communist-Controlled Laos : Global persecution of Christians on the rise&quot; http://freebeacon.com/national-security/christians-tortured-killed-in-communist-controlled-laos/&lt;/ref&gt;
   

The CPPA closely follows the research efforts, and work, of the [[US Commission on International Religious Freedom]], NGOs, and others, concerned about [[religious persecution]] around the globe.

==Laos and the U.S. Congressional Forum  ==

From 1998-2013, the CPPA in cooperation with members of the U.S. Congress has hosted the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos in Washington, D.C.  The U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos brings together policy experts, diplomats, non-governmental organizations, human rights and environmental groups, community leaders, Members of the [[U.S. Congress]] and others to discuss current issues of concern regarding the nation of Laos and the region.

The CPPA is concerned about reports by [[Amnesty International]], independent journalists and others regarding brutal and deadly attacks by the [[Lao People's Army]] (LPA), and VPA against Lao and Hmong civilians, and political and religious dissident groups, in Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (15 January 2009) &quot;Hmong Civilians Suffer Attacks, Atrocities in Laos&quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0901/S00347.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businesswire1&quot;&gt;BUSINESS WIRE, businesswire.com, (4 March 2013) &quot;Laos: Attacks Intensify Against Lao, Hmong People&quot; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130304006755/en/Laos-Attacks-Intensify-Lao-Hmong-People&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPPA accused Laos and Vietnamese troops of killing four Christian Hmong women in [[Xiangkhouang Province]], Laos in 2011. CPPA executive director Philip Smith said Laotian and Vietnamese forces were hunting down Christian and [[animist]] believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/laos-vietnam-troops-kill-hmong-christians/story-e6freuyi-1226040033388|author=The Telegraph|date=16 April 2011|title=Laos, Vietnam troops kill Hmong Christians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_657442.html|author=The Straits Times|date=16 April 2011|title=Laos, Vietnam troops kill four Hmong Christians: NGO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also campaigns for the release of three Hmong American men, from St. Paul, Minnesota, including Mr. Hakit Yang, it said in April 2011 had been falsely imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name=wire&gt;Businesswire, Businesswire.com, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos+Communique+Urges+Release+of+Jailed+Americans%2c+Dissidents%2c+Hmong...-a0232797867 Laos Communique Urges Release of Jailed Americans, Dissidents, Hmong Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), (4 April 2011) &quot;St. Paul Families Plea for Release of Families Held in Laos&quot;&lt;/a&gt;{{cite web| url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/04/21/hmong-americans-held-in-laos/|author=Minnesota Public Radio|date=21 April 2011|title=St. Paul families plea for release of relatives held in Laos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Washington, D.C., the CPPA organized international events urging the release of the three Hmong American men from St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota.  International human rights advocate and former political prisoner Kay Danes served as one of the key note speakers along with Hmong-American advocate Sheng Xiong, wife of Hakit Yang.&lt;ref&gt;BUSINESS WIRE, businesswire.com (23 April 2011), &quot;Laos, Obama Urged By Rights Groups, Hmong, to Free 3 Americans&quot; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110423005016/en/Laos-Obama-Urged-Rights-Groups-Hmong-Free&lt;/ref&gt;  The three Hmong-American citizens include  Mr. Hakit Yang, Mr. Congshineng Yang, and Mr. Trillion Yunhaison.  As of 2013, the three Americans are still missing in Laos, according to their families, NGOs and human rights advocates.

In addition to the three Hmong-Americans, Laos security forces continue to harshly imprison, without charge, political and religious dissidents and they have isolated thousands of ethnic Hmong refugees forced back by the military of Thailand and Laos, according to an international joint communique released by the CPPA and others.&lt;ref name=wire /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary2&quot;&gt;Business Wire, www.businesswire.com, (8 December 2009) [href=&quot;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos%2c+Hmong+Refugee+Crisis%3a+Thailand%27s+PM+Abhisit%2c+Anupong+Should...-a0213797815&quot; Laos, Hmong Refugee Crisis: Thailand's PM Abhisit, Anupong Should Stop Forced Returns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPPA has raised concerns about egregious human rights violations in Laos by the Lao military and has been critical of granting Most Favored Trade Status (MFN), or Normalized Trade Status (NTR), to the communist regime in Laos, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic.  It has also criticized efforts to remove Laos from the trade &quot;blacklist&quot; while it engaged in military attacks against Laotian and Hmong political and religious dissidents, and unarmed Laotian and Hmong civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;businesswire1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press, AFP, &amp; Asia One News, www.asiaone.com, (13 June 2009) &quot;US removes Laos, Cambodia from trade blacklist&quot; http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Story/A1Story20090613-148206.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political prisoners==

On 23 December 2000, just prior to Christmas [[Kerry and Kay Danes]] were arrested by Lao security forces and unjustly imprisoned under harsh conditions and tortured in [[Phonthong Prison]] in [[Vientiane]] by the Lao government while seeking to facilitate major foreign business investment in Laos, according to the Government of [[Australia]] who came to their assistance. Following their release from the Lao government,  Kay Danes and here husband were invited to testified in Washington,D.C., and the U.S. Congress, at the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, and at policy events on current policy issues in Laos, including [[human rights]] violations, torture, [[religious persecution]], [[extrajudicial killing]] and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Danes, www.kaydanes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Sheng Xiong a Hmong-American human rights advocate, also testified with Kay Danes about the arrest, imprisonment and torture of the three Hmong-Americans.  These three Hmong-Americans, Mr. Hakit Yang, Mr. Congshineng Yang, and Mr. Trillion Yunhaison, are still missing in Laos, following their arrest and imprisonment by the Lao People's Army and Lao military and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Chao, Minneapolis Star Tribune, &quot;Waiting, `not knowing if they are even alive'; ...3 St. Paul men thought to be imprisoned in Laos&quot;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-168640538.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (22 April 2011), &quot;Laos: Appeal for Release of 3 Hmong-Americans &quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1104/S00536/laos-appeal-for-release-of-3-hmong-americans.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, James, Washington Times, Washington, D.C.

In 2014, the government of Australia awarded Kay Danes the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] (OAM) for her international humanitarian and human rights work, including her work with foreign prisoners in Laos  and Southeast Asia.  In statements after the award was announced for Danes by officials in [[Canberra]], Mrs. Danes cited the CPPA  as one of the reasons for her continued efforts on behalf of social justice, human rights, foreign prisoners and humanitarian assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, Washington, D.C. &amp; Canberra, Australia, www.businesswire.com (30 January 2014) &quot;Australia Announces Award to Laos, Hmong Human Rights Activist&quot; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140130006717/en/Australia-Announces-Award-Laos-Hmong-Human-Rights#.UxkCwYViZF8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communiques on imprisoned Laotians  ==

The CPPA has issued a number of high-level joint international communiques, and appeals, with leading non-governmental organizations, especially regarding the plight of political and religious dissidents and Indochinese refugees and asylum seekers.

In 2005, the Laos National Federation, the Center for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., the United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., the Lao Association of Washington, D.C., Lao Huam Phao Association, Free Laos Campaign, Inc., the Laos Institute for Democracy, and others, issued a joint communique about human rights violations in Laos involving the Lao government and military as well as the Socialist Republic of [[Vietnam]] (SRV). The communique raised concerns about United Nations findings about racial discrimination against the ethnic Hmong minority in Laos and violations of the Viet-Lao “Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation&quot; by the government and military leaders in [[Hanoi]].&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (9 February 2005)&quot;Joint Communiqué on Laos&quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0502/S00231.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Center for Public Policy Analysis (CPPA), the United League for Democracy in Laos (ULDL) and a coalition of Lao and Hmong non-governmental organizations released a twelve-point joint communique in Bangkok, Thailand, New York, and Washington, D.C., about the egregious religious persecution of minority [[Christian]] and [[Animist]] believers in Laos, and military attacks upon them, as well as the plight of imprisoned Laotian student leaders, political prisoners and Hmong refugees in Laos.  The communique also decried the Lao People's Army attacks on Laotian and Hmong hiding in the jungle and mountains of Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire, Businesswire.com, Bangkok, Thailand and Washington, D.C. (3 August 2010) &quot;Laos Communique Urges Release of Jailed Americans, Dissidents, Hmong Refugees.&quot; http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos+Communique+Urges+Release+of+Jailed+Americans%2c+Dissidents%2c+Hmong...-a0232797867&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Christmas]] Day 2011, the [[Paris]], [[France]]-based Lao Movement for Human Rights, the CPPA and a coalition of NGOs issued a joint international communique about the increased arrest, persecution, torture and killing of minority Laotian and Hmong Christians, including [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] believers in Laos by the government and military. The communique raised concerns about intensified and deepening religious freedom violations in Laos by the Lao government and military.&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Telegraph, Christiantelegraph.com (25 December 2011)  &quot;International Communique: No Christmas in Laos for Christians&quot; http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue15049.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian appeals ==

In 2011, the CPPA issued a joint international statement and appeal, with key NGOs, urging Laos to release political and religious dissidents, and jailed American citizens, prior to a key meeting of the [[communist]] party congress in [[Vientiane]].&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire, Businesswire.com (3 March 2011) &quot;Laos, Hmong Crisis: Rights Groups Make International Appeal.&quot; http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos,+Hmong+Crisis%3A+Rights+Groups+Make+International+Appeal.-a0251583234&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, the CPPA, and its Executive Director, Philip Smith,  issued numerous international appeals and statements urging the [[Pathet Lao]] government in Vientiane to release information and free international humanitarian advocate and [[Magsaysay Award]]-winning civic activist [[Sombath Somphone]] who was arrest by Lao policy and security officials in [[Vientiane]] in December 2012 and disappeared into the Lao prison system.

In February 2013, Smith and the CPPA wrote and editorial published by ''The Nation'' newspaper in Bangkok, Thailand, (Thailand's 2nd largest English Language Daily) urging the Lao government to abide by resolutions passed by the [[European Parliament]] calling for the release of Sombath Somphone and Hmong and Laotian political prisoners, dissidents and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, The Nation, (Editorial) Bangkok, Thailand (15 February 2013)&quot;Laos must abide by European resolution&quot; http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Laos-must-abide-by-European-resolution-30200012.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the CPPA and Philip Smith accused the Lao government and [[communist]] officials of obstructing the investigation into the arrest, abduction and disappearance of Sombath Somphone at the hands of Lao security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News,Auckland, New Zealand, (19 March 2013) &quot;Laos Officials Criticized for Obstructing Investigation&quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1303/S00169/laos-officials-criticized-for-obstructing-investigation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Sombath Somphone's disappearance, and other current matters in Laos, Smith and the CPPA also provided research and information about [[extrajudicial]] killings in Laos by the Lao military and security forces of political and religious dissident and opposition group leaders as well as ongoing human rights violations in Laos and serious [[religious freedom]] violations as reported by the [[US Commission on International Religious Freedom]] and others.  Smith also provided information about the Lao government's ongoing persecution of the Hmong people, including the 2013 killing of Hmong school teachers by soldiers of the Lao People's Army in cooperation with the Vietnam People's Army advisers.

==Thailand and repatriation of refugees==

The CPPA has a long and successful track-record of work with Indochinese refugees and asylum seekers in Southeast Asia.
It played a leading role regarding the plight of Lao Hmong refugees and asylum seekers who sought refugee in camps along the Mekong River and Thai-Lao border, [[Wat Tham Krabok]] and the camps and detention center at Ban Huay Nam Khao, White Water, Petchabun Province, Thailand.

From 1989-2013, Philip Smith and the CPPA were involved in major efforts to halt, stop, and reverse the forced repatriation of tens of thousands of Laotian and Hmong political refugees and asylum seekers in Southeast Asia, and were successful in having tens of thousands granted political asylum in the United States and in other third countries, including Canada, France, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.  The CPPA also played a major international role in raising human rights concerns about the thousands of Lao Hmong refugees that were forcibly repatriated from these camp in Thailand back to the communist regime in Laos that they fled.&lt;ref name=&quot;johns1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, atimes.com, (13 June 2008), &quot;The Wrong Way to End A Secret War&quot; http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JF13Ae01.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary1&quot;&gt;Business Wire, businesswire.com (19 July 2010) &quot;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Laos+Communique+Urges+Release+of+Jailed+Americans%2c+Dissidents%2c+Hmong...-a0232797867 Laos Communique Urges Release of Jailed Americans, Dissidents, Hmong Refugees]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press (AFP), (12 January 2010) [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/US+lawmakers+see+no+ill-treatment+of+Hmong-a01612117823 US lawmakers see no ill-treatment of Hmong]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asia Business Newsweekly (12 January 2010) &quot;Senate Questions U.S.-Thailand Military Funding as Anupong, Abhisit Move To Force Hmong to Laos&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-215986631.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution of Viet Hmong protestors  ==

The CPPA said that Vietnamese troops had killed 28 Hmong Catholic and Protestant Christian protesters, during one period, in [[Dien Bien Phu]] area of Vietnam, with hundreds more missing, following multi-day anti-government protests in Vietnam near the Laos border in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;America (Magazine), (23 May 2011) &quot;Dozens reported killed in Hmong protest&quot; http://americamagazine.org &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-06/u-s-probes-reports-of-deaths-after-hmong-protests-in-vietnam.html|author=Bloomberg|date=6 May 2011|title=Protests in Vietnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;America: National Catholic Review (Magazine) (23 May 2011) &quot;Dozens Reported Killed in Hmong Protest&quot; http://americamagazine.org/issue/777/signs/dozens-reported-killed-hmong-protest&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (10 May 2011)  &quot;Vietnam: 14 Die as Troops Converge On Hmong&quot;  http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1105/S00181/vietnam-14-die-as-troops-converge-on-hmong.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPPA and others claim more Vietnamese Hmong were killed, wounded, or &quot;disappeared&quot; by Vietnamese and Laotian security forces  during the long anti-government protest which involved issues of religious freedom, religious freedom violations, land reform, illegal logging, and concerns about government corruption.&lt;ref&gt;UCA News, ucanews.com, (9 May 2011) &quot;Christians killed in Dien Bien Phu protests&quot; http://www.ucanews.com/news/christians-killed-in-dien-bien-phu-protests/15807&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (7 May 2011) &quot;Vietnam Crackdown: More Hmong Killed As Army Deploys&quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1105/S00147/vietnam-crackdown-more-hmong-killed-as-army-deploys.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical research and veterans memorial ceremonies==

The CPPA has taken a leadership role in organizing major national veterans' recognition ceremonies at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Congress, especially to honor Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their American advisers, who served in the clandestine theater of the Royal Kingdom Laos during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;BUSINESS WIRE, businesswire.com , Washington, D.C., (12 May 2013) &quot;Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored At National Ceremonies&quot;   http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130512005048/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Vietnam-War-Honored-National&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Center for Public Policy Analysis played a key role in commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War at ceremonies held with the Southeast Asian-American and Lao- and Hmong-American community in the [[Central Valley]] and Fresno, California.  The events were recognized and memorialized by the U.S. Congress &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Congressional Record, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. &quot;U.S. CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE LAO AND HMONG VETERANS COMMEMORATION CEREMONY IN FRESNO, CA, MARKING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FALL OF SOUTHEAST ASIA TO COMMUNISM&quot; (13 June 1995)https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/13/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e1228-4 &lt;/ref&gt;

The CPPA works with major veterans organizations, including the [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc. the Lao Veterans of America Institute, the U.S. Special Forces Association, and others, to seek to honor Lao and Hmong veterans who served in the &quot;U.S. Secret Army&quot; in Laos during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;Lao Veterans of America, Inc. http://www.laoveteransofamerica.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laoveterans.org&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1997, the CPPA worked with these organization to help dedicate the Laos and Hmong Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery [[Laos Memorial]].

The CPPA's Philip Smith has commented publicly, on a number of occasions, about U.S. intelligence community and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] figures, and operations, including Vietnam and [[Cold War]] era figures and activities, undertaken by both Democratic and Republican Administrations, including such officials as [[William Colby]], [[Tony Poe]], Lawrence Devlin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Times, (8 May 1996) &quot;Refugees from Laos mourn a friend, Colby: Tribe worked closely with ex-CIA leader&quot; http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=sea&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the CPPA campaigned for former Hmong leader and [[Royal Lao Army]] [[Lieutenant General]] [[Vang Pao]] to be given a memorial service in [[Arlington Cemetery]] after US authorities refused to grant him the right to be buried there. Pao was arrested in the US in 2007 on charges of plotting to overthrow the one-party, communist Laos' Government, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR); The charges against General Vang Pao were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html/|author=Asia One News|date=13 May 2011|title=Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPPA's Executive Director, Philip Smith, wrote an editorial in the Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'' outlining Vang Pao's contribution to U.S. national security interests during the Vietnam War following the Lao-Hmong leaders death in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Star Tribune, Minneapolis, Minnesota ( 7 March 2011), &quot;Vang Pao Burial Decision A Disgrace: Lao Hmong veterans who fought in America's covert war should be fully honored&quot; http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/117551498.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPPA's Philip Smith persisted in his efforts, and the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., the [[Lao Veterans of America Institute]], and others, helped to organize national veterans ceremonies in May 2011 to officially honor Vang Pao at Arlington National Cemetery  &lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press (AFP) &amp; Asia One News, (13 May 2011) &quot;Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub&quot; http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honorary U.S. citizenship and burial honors==


The CPPA worked with Members of the U.S. Congress beginning in the early 1990s, and with Colonel Wangyee Vang and [[Cherzong Vang]] of the [[Lao Veterans of America]], and other community leaders, to research and propose efforts to grant honorary U.S. citizenship to Lao- and Hmong-American veterans of the U.S. Secret Army in Laos.  As a result, bipartisan legislation was introduced by U.S. Congressman [[Bruce Vento]] (D-MN) and Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] (D-MN) of Minnesota, &quot; The [[Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000]]&quot;.  After a ten year effort by the Center for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Veterans of America, the [[Lao Veterans of America Institute]] and others, the legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, at the time, and signed into law by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.

The CPPA continues to engage and educate U.S. policymakers and Members of Congress about the plight of many of the Lao and Hmong-American veterans.  Significant numbers of the veterans, estimated to be about 10,800 in the United States, are seeking the passage of burial honors and benefits legislation so they can be buried in U.S. national veterans cemeteries administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  U.S. Congressmen [[Jim Costa]] (D-CA) and [[Paul Cook]] (R-CA) of California, and U.S. Senators [[Lisa Murkowski]] (R-AK) and [[Mark Begich]] (D-AK), introduced legislation seeking to grant burial honors to the Lao- and Hmong-American veterans.&lt;ref&gt;China Weekly News (10 August 2010) &quot;Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored by Congress with National Burial Bill.&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-234438009.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, New Zealand, (21 October 2011) &quot;Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Fight For Burial Honors&quot; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1110/S00673/laos-hmong-veterans-of-vietnam-war-fight-for-burial-honors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Weekly News (19 February 2013) &quot;Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill Introduced in U.S. Senate&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-320483452.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Business Journal (08 February 2013)&quot;Murkowski, Costa introduce Lao and Hmong veterans bill&quot; http://www.thebusinessjournal.com/news/government-and-politics/4920-murkowski-costa-introduce-lao-and-hmong-veterans-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Weekly News (30 July 2013) &quot;Senate Slated to Address Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-339279014.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health &amp; Beauty Close-Up (19 November 2013)&quot;Events Nationwide Recognize Lao, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-349506835.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Politics &amp; Government Week (28 November 2013) &quot;Laos, Hmong Veterans Honored with Ceremonies, U.S. Congressional Legislation&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-352917871.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Weekly News (27 May 2014) &quot;Laotian, Hmong-Americans Join U.S. Senators, CPPA, in Renewed Offensive in Congress&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-370580019.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Laotian- and Hmong-American community leaders and Vietnam war veterans, and their refugee families, from California, Alaska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Arkansas and other states,participated in national memorial ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery. They also engaged in high-level meetings in the U.S. Congress and Washington, D.C. with the CPPA regarding pending Lao Hmong veterans burial honors legislation. Consequently, the Hmong and Lao Veterans of the Vietnam War, and their families, continue to be recognized and honored by the U.S. Congress, [[White House]], Obama Administration, and Arlington National Cemetery. Moreover, despite delays and some setbacks, the Lao Hmong veterans burial honors legislation continues to gather support and co-sponsors, including official co-sponsorship by U.S. Senators [[Bernard Sanders]] (I-VT), [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-CA), [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA), [[Amy Klobuchar]] (D-MN), [[Al Franken]] (D-MN), [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI), [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI), [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-WI)  and others.&lt;ref&gt;Defense &amp; Aerospace Week (4 June 2014),&quot;Arlington National Cemetery, U.S. Congress, Officials Honor Lao, Hmong-American Veterans&quot; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-371064468.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire (24 October 2014), Washington, D.C., www.businesswire.com &quot;Vietnam Veterans of U.S. Secret Army in Laos Urge Congress to Act&quot; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141024005848/en/Vietnam-Veterans-U.S.-Secret-Army-Laos-Urge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Kirsten, Mountain View Press &amp; Anchorage Press, Anchorage, Alaska (5 November 2014)&quot;Due Respect&quot; http://www.anchoragepress.com/news/1/due-respect&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of India}}

The name ''India'' is derived from ''Indus'', which originates from the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindus|Hinduš]]''. The latter term stems from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu'', which was the historical local appellation for the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians as ''Indoi'' (Ινδοί), which translates as &quot;the people of the Indus&quot;.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}}

The geographical term ''Bharat'' ({{IPA-hns|ˈbʱaːrət̪|pron|hi-Bharat.ogg}}), which is recognised by the [[Constitution of India]] as an official name for the country,{{sfn|Ministry of Law and Justice 2008}} is used by [[Names of the Republic of India in its official languages|many Indian languages]] in its variations. The [[eponym]] of ''Bharat'' is [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]], a theological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India.

''[[Hindustan]]'' ({{IPA-hns|ɦɪnd̪ʊˈst̪aːn||Hindustan.ogg}}) was originally a [[Persian language|Persian]] word that meant &quot;Land of the Hindus&quot;; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and [[Pakistan]]. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety.{{sfn|Kaye|1997|pp = 639–640}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}}

{{Main|History of India|History of the Republic of India}}

===Ancient India===
The earliest authenticated [[Anatomically modern humans|human]] remains in [[South Asia]] date to about 30,000 years ago.{{sfn|Petraglia|Allchin||2007|p=6}} Nearly contemporaneous [[Mesolithic]] rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 89–93}} Around 7000 BCE, the first known [[Neolithic]] settlements appeared on the subcontinent in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in western Pakistan.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|pp = 24–25}} These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]],{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 21–23}} the first urban culture in South Asia;{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}} It flourished during 2600–1900&amp;nbsp;BCE in Pakistan and western India.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|p = 2}} Centred on cities such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Kalibangan]], and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 181}}
[[Image:Early Vedic Culture (1700-1100 BCE).png|thumb|right|200px|Early Vedic Period.]]
During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the [[Chalcolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}} were composed during this period,{{sfn|Witzel|2003|pp = 68–69}} and historians have analysed these to posit a [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 31}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 186–187}} The [[caste system]] arose during this period, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, free peasants and traders, and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure; and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical, state-level polities.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 41–43}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 200}} On the [[Deccan Plateau]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 255}} In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of [[megalith]]ic monuments dating from this period,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}} as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 250–251}}
[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra]], 6th century]]

In the late [[Vedic period]], around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the [[Ganges]] Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ''[[mahajanapada]]s''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 260-265}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 53–54}} The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created heterodox religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Buddhism, based on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 54–56}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 21}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 67–68}} Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 312–313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 300}} and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 78–79}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 70}} The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka]]'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]]''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 367}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 63}}

The [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], and the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[Western Asia|West]] and [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 89–90}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 408–415}} In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 92–95}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 319}} By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 89–91}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 98–99}} The renewal was reflected in a flowering of [[Sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]] and [[Architecture of India|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p = 545}}

===Medieval India===
[[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The granite [[gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].]]

The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}}

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the Tamil language.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of India|modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}} Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}}

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 68}} The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 47}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 6}} By repeatedly repulsing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol raiders]] in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of [[Human migration|migration]] of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 67}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp = 50–51}} The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}} Embracing a strong [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 12}} and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}}

===Early modern India===
[[File:Moghul.1590-95гг.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Writing the will and testament of the Mughal king court in Persian, 1590–1595]]

In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers,{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 80}} fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 164}} The resulting [[Mughal Empire]] did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 90–91}} and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under [[Akbar]], the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 158}} and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 169}} caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} resulting in greater patronage of [[Mughal painting|painting]], literary forms, textiles, and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 186}} Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajputs]], and the [[Sikh empire|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 256}} The &quot;single most important power&quot; that emerged in the early modern period was the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46984/Political-and-economic-decentralization-during-the-Mughal-decline#toc46986 |title=Regional states, c. 1700–1850 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English [[East India Company]], had established coastal outposts.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 44–49}} The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the [[Bengal]] region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 98–100}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Ludden|2002|pp = 128–132}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 51–55}} Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 68–71}} India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}} By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 289}}

Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor General of the [[Company rule in India|East India Company]] set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the [[English Education Act 1835|education]] of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 151–152}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 94–99}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p = 83}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p = 50}} However, disaffection with the Company also grew during this time, and set off the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 100–103}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|pp = 85–86}} Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the [[British Raj|direct administration of India]] by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 239}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 103–108}} In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1885.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 183}}{{sfn|Sarkar|1983|pp = 1–4}}{{sfn|Copland|2001|pp = ix–x}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 123}}

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 260}} There was an increase in the number of large-scale [[Famine in India|famines]],{{sfn|Bose|Jalal|2011|p = 117}} and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 258}} There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} The railway network provided critical famine relief,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} notably reduced the cost of moving goods,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 97}} and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 126}} After World War I, in which [[Indian Army during World War I|some one million Indians served]],{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 163}} a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a [[nonviolent]] movement of non-cooperation, of which [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] would become the leader and enduring symbol.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 167}} During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 195–197}} The next decade was beset with crises: [[India in World War II|Indian participation in World War II]], the Congress's final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism.

India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]], and part of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], began a north-eastward [[Plate tectonics|drift]] caused by [[seafloor spreading]] to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  Simultaneously, the vast [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyn]] [[oceanic crust]], to its northeast, began to [[subduction|subduct]] under the [[Eurasian plate]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}}  These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], both created the [[Indian Ocean]] and caused the Indian [[continental crust]] eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the [[Himalayas]].{{sfn|Ali|Aitchison|2005}} Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast [[trough (geology)|trough]] that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 7}} and now constitutes the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Prakash et al.|2000}} Cut off from the plain by the ancient [[Aravalli Range]] lies the [[Thar Desert]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 11}}

The original Indian plate survives as [[South India|peninsular India]], the oldest and geologically most stable part of India.  It extends as far north as the [[Satpura Range|Satpura]] and [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in Jharkhand in the east.{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 8}} To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the [[Deccan Plateau]], is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]];{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|pp = 9–10}} the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old.

India's coastline measures {{Convert|7517|km|mi|-2}} in length; of this distance, {{Convert|5423|km|mi|-2}} belong to peninsular India and {{Convert|2094|km|mi|-2}} to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}} According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% [[mudflat]]s or marshy shores.{{sfn|Kumar|Pathak|Pednekar|Raju|2006}}

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the [[Ganges]] and the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], both of which drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 15}} Important tributaries of the Ganges include the [[Yamuna]] and the [[Kosi River|Kosi]]; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes.{{sfn|Duff|1993|p = 353}} Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]], which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 16}} and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and the [[Tapti River|Tapti]], which drain into the [[Arabian Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 17}} Coastal features include the marshy [[Rann of Kutch]] of western India and the alluvial [[Sundarbans]] delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 12}} India has two archipelagos: the [[Lakshadweep]], coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the [[Andaman Sea]].{{sfn|Dikshit &amp; Schwartzberg|p = 13}}

The [[Climate of India|Indian climate]] is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter [[monsoon]]s.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian [[katabatic wind]]s from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.{{sfn|Posey|1994|p = 118}}{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 4}} The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.{{sfn|Chang|1967|pp = 391–394}} Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: [[Climate of India#Tropical wet|tropical wet]], [[Climate of India#Tropical dry|tropical dry]], [[Climate of India#Subtropical humid|subtropical humid]], and [[Climate of India#Mountain|montane]].{{sfn|Heitzman|Worden|1996|p = 97}}

For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,{{sfn|Sarkar|2007|p = 84}} as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party [[coalition government|coalitions]] at the centre.{{sfn|Chander|2004|p = 117}}

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by [[Indira Gandhi]], who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new [[Janata Party]], which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a [[National Front (India)|National Front]] coalition, led by the newly formed [[Janata Dal]] in alliance with the [[Left Front (India)|Left Front]], won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived: it lasted just under two years.{{sfn|Bhambhri|1992|pp = 118, 143}} Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. But the Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a [[minority government]] led by [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]].{{sfn|The Hindu 2008}}

A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA). Led by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the NDA became the first non-Congress, [[coalition government]] to complete a five-year term.{{sfn|Dunleavy|Diwakar|Dunleavy|2007}} In the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 Indian general elections]], again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the [[Indian general election, 2009|2009 general election]] with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from [[Socialism in India|India's communist parties]].{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p = 384}} That year, [[Manmohan Singh]] became the first prime minister since [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in [[Indian general election, 1957|1957]] and [[Indian general election, 1962|1962]] to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.{{sfn|Business Standard|2009}} In the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]], Bharatiya Janata Party became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BJP first party since 1984 to win parliamentary majority on its own|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-first-party-since-1984-to-win-parliamentary-majority-on-its-own-1988981|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=DNA|date=16 May 2014|agency=IANS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Prime Minister]] of India is [[Narendra Modi]] who was also the former [[Chief Minister]] of [[Gujarat]].

Since its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations.

Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 15}} During the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Hindu mythology|mythology]], [[Hindu theology|theology]] and [[Hindu texts|literature]] were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as ''[[Dharma|dhárma]]'', ''[[Karma|kárma]]'', ''[[yoga|yóga]]'', and ''[[moksha|mokṣa]]'', were established.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p = 86}} India is notable for its [[Indian religions|religious diversity]], with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Jainism]] among the nation's major religions.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{sfn|Deutsch|1969|pp = 3, 78}} the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]]'', the [[Bhakti|''Bhakti'' movement]],{{sfn|Heehs|2002|pp = 2–5}} and by [[Buddhist philosophy]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1999}}

===Art and architecture===
Much of [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], including the [[Taj Mahal]], other works of [[Mughal architecture]], and [[Dravidian architecture|South Indian architecture]], blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|pp = 296–329}} [[Indian vernacular architecture|Vernacular architecture]] is also highly regional in it flavours. ''[[Vastu shastra]]'', literally &quot;science of construction&quot; or &quot;architecture&quot; and ascribed to [[Mamuni Mayan]],{{sfn|Silverman|2007|p = 20}} explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;{{sfn|Kumar|2000|p = 5}} it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|p = 73}} As applied in [[Hindu temple architecture]], it is influenced by the ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'', a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the ''Vastu-Purusha mandala'', a square that embodied the &quot;[[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lang|Moleski|2010|pp = 151–152}} The Taj Mahal, built in [[Agra]] between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] in memory of his wife, has been described in the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] as &quot;the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.&quot;{{sfn|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation}} [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on [[Indo-Islamic architecture]].{{sfn|Chopra|2011|p = 46}}

===Literature===
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Hoiberg|Ramchandani|2000}}{{sfn|Sarma|2009}} Prominent works of this [[Sanskrit literature]] include [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] such as the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the dramas of [[Kālidāsa]] such as the ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'' (''[[The Recognition of Śakuntalā]]''), and poetry such as the ''[[Sanskrit Classical poetry|Mahākāvya]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|2008}}{{sfn|MacDonell|2004|pp = 1–40}}{{sfn|Kālidāsa|Johnson|2001}} [[Kamasutra]], the famous book about [[sexual intercourse]] also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the [[Sangam literature|''Sangam'' literature]], consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of [[Tamil literature]].{{sfn|Zvelebil|1997|p = 12}}{{sfn|Hart|1975}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2008}}{{sfn|Ramanujan|1985|pp = ix–x}} From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of [[Bhakti movement|devotional poets]] such as [[Kabir|Kabīr]], [[Tulsidas|Tulsīdās]], and [[Guru Nanak|Guru Nānak]]. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.{{sfn|Das|2005}} In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the [[Works of Rabindranath Tagore|works]] of Bengali poet and novelist [[Rabindranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Datta|2006}}

[[Music of India|Indian music]] ranges over various traditions and regional styles. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and southern [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] schools.{{sfn|Massey|Massey|1998}} Regionalised popular forms include [[filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]]; the syncretic tradition of the ''[[baul]]s'' is a well-known form of the latter. [[Dance in India|Indian dance]] also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known [[List of Indian folk dances|folk dances]] are the ''[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]'' of Punjab, the ''[[bihu dance|bihu]]'' of Assam, the ''[[Chhau dance|chhau]]'' of Odisha,  West Bengal and Jharkhand, ''[[Garba (dance)|garba]]'' and ''[[Dandiya Raas|dandiya]]'' of Gujarat, ''[[ghoomar]]'' of Rajasthan, and the ''[[lavani]]'' of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded [[Classical Indian dance|classical dance status]] by India's [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama]]. These are: ''[[Bharata Natyam|bharatanatyam]]'' of the state of Tamil Nadu, ''[[kathak]]'' of Uttar Pradesh, ''[[kathakali]]'' and ''[[mohiniyattam]]'' of Kerala,'' [[kuchipudi]]'' of Andhra Pradesh, ''[[Manipuri dance|manipuri]]'' of Manipur, ''[[odissi]]'' of Odisha&lt;!--Do not change this per [[WP:COMMONNAME]].--&gt;, and the ''[[sattriya]]'' of Assam.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica b}} [[Theatre in India]] melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.{{sfn|Lal|2004|pp = 23, 30, 235}} Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the ''[[bhavai]]'' of Gujarat, the ''[[Jatra (Bengal)|jatra]]'' of West Bengal, the ''[[nautanki]]'' and ''[[ramlila]]'' of North India, ''[[tamasha]]'' of Maharashtra, ''[[burrakatha]]'' of Andhra Pradesh, ''[[terukkuttu]]'' of Tamil Nadu, and the ''[[yakshagana]]'' of Karnataka.{{sfn|Karanth|2002|p = 26}}

===Motion pictures, television===

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as ''[[jāti]]s'', or &quot;castes&quot;.{{sfn|Schwartzberg|2011}} India declared untouchability to be illegal&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spiritual Terrorism: Spiritual Abuse from the Womb to the Tomb&quot;, p. 391, by Boyd C. Purcell&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance.{{sfn|Messner|2009|p = 51-53}}{{sfn|Messner|2012|p = 27-28}} Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.{{sfn|Makar|2007}} An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|their marriages arranged]] by their parents or other family members.{{sfn|Medora|2003}} Marriage is thought to be for life,{{sfn|Medora|2003}} and the divorce rate is extremely low.{{sfn|Jones|Ramdas|2005|p = 111}} [[Child marriage]]s are common, especially in rural areas; many [[women in India]] wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.{{sfn|Cullen-Dupont|2009|p = 96}} [[Female infanticide in India]] and [[female foeticide in India]] have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation.{{sfn|Bunting|2011}}{{sfn|Agnivesh|2005}} However the recent report from 2011 shown improvement among the gender ratio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_And_You/gender_composition.aspx Census of India-Gender Composition] 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The payment of [[Dowry system in India|Dowry]], although [[Dowry law in India|illegal]], remains widespread across class lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10280802/Woman-killed-over-dowry-every-hour-in-India.html|title=Woman killed over dowry 'every hour' in India |publisher=telegraph.com |accessdate=10 February 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dowry deaths|Deaths resulting from dowry]], mostly from [[bride burning]], is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rising-number-of-dowry-deaths-in-india-ncrb/article4995677.ece|title=Rising number of dowry deaths in India:NCRB|publisher=thehindu.com |accessdate=10 February 2014|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Public holidays in India|Indian festivals]] are religious in origin; among them are [[Chhath]], [[Christmas worldwide#Republic of India|Christmas]], [[Diwali]], [[Durga Puja]], [[Eid al-Adha|Bakr-Id]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Holi]], [[Makar Sankranti|Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan]], [[Navratri]], [[Thai Pongal]], and [[Vaisakhi]]. India has [[Public holidays in India|three national holidays]] which are observed in all states and union territories: [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]], [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]], and [[Gandhi Jayanti]]. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states.

Throughout India, many people practice customs and religious rituals, such as &quot;[[Saṃskāra]],&quot; which is a series of &quot;personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/273190/Housing India]&quot;.

Traditional [[Clothing in India|Indian dress]] varies in colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as the ''[[sari]]'' for women and the ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'' for men. Stitched clothes, such as the ''[[shalwar kameez]]'' for women and ''[[kurta]]''–''[[Pajamas|pyjama]]'' combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|pp = xii, xii, 11, 15, 28, 46}} Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.{{sfn|Eraly|2008|p = 160}}

In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as ''[[kabaddi]]'', ''[[kho kho]]'', ''[[pehlwani]]'' and ''[[gilli-danda]]''. Some of the earliest forms of Asian [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]], such as ''[[kalarippayattu]]'', ''[[musti yuddha]]'', ''[[silambam]]'', and ''[[marma adi]]'', originated in India. [[Chess]], commonly held to have [[History of chess#India|originated in India]] as ''[[chaturanga|chaturaṅga]]'', is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]].{{sfn|Wolpert|2003|p = 2}}{{sfn|Rediff 2008 b}} ''[[Pachisi]]'', from which [[parcheesi]] derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.{{sfn|Binmore|2007|p = 98}}

The improved results garnered by the [[India Davis Cup team|Indian Davis Cup team]] and other [[:Category:Indian tennis players|Indian tennis players]] in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.{{sfn|The Wall Street Journal 2009}} India has a [[:Category:Indian sport shooters|comparatively strong presence]] in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the [[ISSF World Shooting Championships|World Shooting Championships]], and the Commonwealth Games.{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 b}}{{sfn|The Times of India 2010}} Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,{{sfn|British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 a}} boxing,{{sfn|Mint 2010}} and wrestling.{{sfn|Xavier|2010}} [[Football in India|Football]] is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.{{sfn|Majumdar|Bandyopadhyay|2006|pp = 1–5}}

[[Field hockey in India]] is administered by [[Hockey India]]. The [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian national hockey team]] won the 1975 [[Hockey World Cup]] and have, as of 2012, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.

[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|thumb|250px|right| In a career of twenty four-year span, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] has created almost all batting records, including most runs in both tests and ODIs and most number of centuries in both tests and ODIs, thus making him the most successful cricketer ever.]]
India has also played a major role in popularising [[cricket]]. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport of India. The [[India national cricket team|Indian national cricket team]] won the [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] events, the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], shared the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and won [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. [[Cricket in India]] is administered by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI); the [[Ranji Trophy]], the [[Duleep Trophy]], the [[Deodhar Trophy]], the [[Irani Trophy]], and the [[NKP Salve Challenger Trophy]] are domestic competitions. The BCCI is also responsible for conducting an annual [[Twenty20]] competition known as the [[Indian Premier League]].

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1982 Asian Games]]; the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]], and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] tournaments; the [[2003 Afro-Asian Games]]; the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]]; the [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup|2010 Hockey World Cup]]; and the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the [[Chennai Open]], the [[Mumbai Marathon]], the [[Delhi Half Marathon]], and the [[Indian Masters]]. The first [[Indian Grand Prix]] featured in late 2011.{{sfn|Dehejia|2011}}

India has traditionally been the dominant country at the [[South Asian Games]]. An example of this dominance is the [[Basketball at the South Asian Games|basketball competition]] where [[India national basketball team|Team India]] won three out of four tournaments to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/02-Jan-2010/Basketball-team-named-for-11th-South-Asian-Games |title=Basketball team named for 11th South Asian Games |publisher=Nation.com.pk |date=2 January 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]] and the [[Arjuna Award]] are the highest forms of government recognition for athletic achievement; the [[Dronacharya Award]] is awarded for excellence in coaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="945">'''Indo-Norwegian Project'''  was Norway's first Foreign aid/development project.

The project was first established in [[Neendakara]], near  [[Quilon]], Kerala in 1952, and the aim was  modernisation of fisheries of  Kerala, but also including  health, sanitation and water supply.(including building a [[water pipe]] factory)

The  project was moved to [[Ernakulam]] in 1961, now focusing on fisheries only. 
At Ernakulam an [[iceplant]] and workshop with [[slipway]] for fishing vessels were built.

During the years  1952 - 1972, Norway gave technical and financial assistance to India to the tune of 120 million Norwegian kroner.
